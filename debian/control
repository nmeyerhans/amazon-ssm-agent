Description: On-host component of Amazon Simple Systems Manager
 The SSM Agent runs on EC2 instances and enables you to quickly and
 easily execute remote commands or scripts against one or more
 instances.
 .
 The agent uses SSM documents. When you execute a command, the agent
 on the instance processes the document and configures the instance as
 specified. Currently, the agent and Run Command enable you to quickly
 run Shell scripts on an instance using the AWS-RunShellScript SSM
 document. SSM Agent also enables the Session Manager capability that
 lets you manage your Amazon EC2 instance through an interactive
 one-click browser-based shell or through the AWS CLI. When the agent
 starts, it will create a user called "ssm-user" with sudo or
 administrator privilege. Session Manager sessions will be launched in
 context of this user.
